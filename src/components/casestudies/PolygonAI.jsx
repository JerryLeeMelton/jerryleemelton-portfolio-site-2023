              <h3>Polygon AI</h3>
              <h4>Challenge:</h4>
              <p>
                Pipsqueak Pro, now known as Polygon AI, offered powerful but
                very specific and technical capabilities that were hampered by
                an unfocused user interface design.
              </p>
              <h4>Solution: </h4>
              <p>
                A rebranding and interface redesign that clarifies UI sections
                and provides a more focused and cohesive user experience.
              </p>
              <h4>Original State</h4>
              <p>
                Originally, Pipsqueak Pro users were presented with three panels
                with various functions nested in each.; There was no clear flow
                for users to take when working on a project and features were
                not grouped together in intuitive ways. Additionally, the Rewire
                team had no designer prior to my joining the company so the
                visual styling was unfocused which further contributed to user
                confusion.
              </p>
              <h4>Redesign Process</h4>
              <p>
                The name Polygon AI was chosen by the team to better reflect the
                capabilities of the software, which centers around annotating
                images with shapes referred to as regions of interest (R.O.I.s),
                as well as the company's forward-thinking, AI-focused business.
              </p>
              <p>
                As the company's newly hired designer, I had the opportunity to
                lead the redesign process, which began with the application's
                logo.
