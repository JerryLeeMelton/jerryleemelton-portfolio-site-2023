              <p class="marg-bottom-one-and-half">
                Originally, Pipsqueak Pro presented users with three panels
                which had various functions nested in each. There was no clear
                flow for users to follow when working on a project and features
                were not grouped together in intuitive ways. Additionally, the
                Rewire team had no designer prior to me joining the company and
                the resulting unfocused visual styling further contributed to
                user confusion.

              <p class="marg-bottom-one-and-half">
                The name Polygon AI was chosen by the team to better reflect the
                capabilities of the software, which centers around annotating
                images with shapes referred to as regions of interest (R.O.I.s),
                as well as the company's forward-thinking, AI-focused business.
                As the company's newly hired designer, I had the opportunity to
                lead the redesign process, which began with the application's
                logo.
              </p>
              <img
                src="assets/img/casestudies/polygon/pip_vs_poly_logos.webp"

                class="marg-bottom-one-and-half"
              />
              <p className="marg-bottom-three">
                After many sketches and iterations, we decided on a logo that
                was sleeker and more edgy than the previous Pipsqueak Pro logo.
                The team felt that the angular design fit the cutting edge
                aesthetic that we wanted to bring to the re-branded app. This
                would then inform the creative direction for the interface
                design going forward.
              </p>
              <h6 className="marg-bottom-one-and-half">Interface Redesign</h6>
              <img
                src="assets/img/casestudies/polygon/polygon_casestudy_hero_cropped.webp"
                alt="Polygon Main Image"
                class="marg-bottom-three"
              />
              <p>
                When approaching the redesign of the interface for Polygon, one
                of the biggest challenges that we faced was the non-linear
                nature of the user workflow. Users would often bounce around
                from section to section and complete tasks in an order that was
                particular to them, so it was important to us to allow for that
                while bringing better visual organization to the application.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ultimately, we decided to keep the three panel design that the
                app current had, but we added icon-based buttons along the left
                and right borders of the app that would serve as navigation.
                This allowed us to create clear sections in the app while
                keeping the layout similar for existing users.

              <h4 className="marg-bottom-one-and-half">Additional Features</h4>
              <h6 className="marg-bottom-half">Color Themes</h6>
              <p className="marg-bottom-one-and-half">
                As part of the improvements to the user interface, I was also
                responsible for adding color themes to Polygon AI. This added to
                the polish of Polygon as well as provides users with a better
                experience by allowing them to customize the appearance of the
                app to suit their personal preference. I implemented themes into
                Polygon in a way that was extensible, leaving open the option to
                add fun and functional new color themes in the future.

              <h6 className="marg-bottom-half">In-App Tutorials</h6>
              <p className="marg-bottom-one-and-half">
                As I finalized the interface improvements that I had designed,
                the Rewire team decided that some of the app's more specialized
                features would benefit from more direct guidance than our help
                documentation could provide. Consequently, I implemented a
                series of guided, in-app tutorials for Polygon AI to help users
                better understand the features of the app. This further improved
                usability and user retention for Polygon, which directly
                translated into increased revenue for the company.

              <h6 className="marg-bottom-half">Analytics</h6>
              <p className="marg-bottom-three">
                Another important feature that I created for Polygon was the
                ability to track user analytics data. This helped the team to
                better understand user behavior and any potential pain points in
                the user experience.

                I was fortunate to join Rewire relatively early in their
                existence as a company. As such, I had the opportunity to do a
                lot of very exciting and impactful work on Polygon AI. I am
                extremely proud of what I acheived with Polygon and I am excited
                to carry the lessons that I learned while working on it through
                to my future projects.
