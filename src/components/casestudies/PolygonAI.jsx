              <h6>Challenge:</h6>
              <p>
                Pipsqueak Pro, now known as Polygon AI, offered powerful but
                very technical and niche capabilities that were hampered by an
                unfocused user interface design.
              </p>
              <h6>Solution: </h6>
              <p>
                A rebranding and interface redesign that clarifies UI sections
                and provides a more focused and cohesive user experience.
              </p>
              <h4>Original State</h4>
              <p>
                Originally, Pipsqueak Pro presented users with three panels
                which had various functions nested in each. There was no clear
                flow for users to follow when working on a project and features
                were not grouped together in intuitive ways. Additionally, the
                Rewire team had no designer prior to me joining the company and
                the resulting unfocused visual styling further contributed to
                user confusion.

              <h4>Redesign Process</h4>
              <h6>Name and Logo</h6>
              <p>
                The name Polygon AI was chosen by the team to better reflect the
                capabilities of the software, which centers around annotating
                images with shapes referred to as regions of interest (R.O.I.s),
                as well as the company's forward-thinking, AI-focused business.
                As the company's newly hired designer, I had the opportunity to
                lead the redesign process, which began with the application's
                logo.

              <p>
                After many sketches and iterations, we decided on a logo that
                was sleeker and more edgy than the previous Pipsqueak Pro logo.
                The team felt that the angular design fit the cutting edge
                aesthetic that we wanted to bring to the re-branded app. This
                would then inform the creative direction for the interface
                design going forward.
